Having a Notebook to build, run _and_ discuss algorithm in C++ would be great. This docker setup aims to do just that.

## TODO
`[ ]` Figure out a way to export, import and install the C++ conda environment to supper `docker-compose up / down` command  
`[ ]` Annotate and explain each step of the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` file.  
`[ ]` Write some C++ code and try out each Kernel that is available.  
`[?]` Is C++ 20 available or coming soon in CLing?
